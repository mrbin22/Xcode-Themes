# WWDC-Xcode-Themes

A collection of Xcode themes based on the keynote presentations of WWDC.

A Xcode Theme defines the style of the Source Editor and the Console and it sets the following attributes for each keyword category:

* Font Family
* Font Weight
* Font Size
* Color

It is also possible to set the color for:

* Editor Background
* Current Line
* Text Selection
* Cursor
* Invisibles (not sure what this mean exactly)

For the Source Editor you can also customize:

* Spacing (Tight, Normal, Relaxed)
* Type of cursor (Vertical Bar, Underline or Block)


## Installing the Themes on Xcode

To install a Xcode Theme is simple:

1. Copy the ```.xccolortheme``` file
2. Go to the ```~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/``` folder using **CMD⌘ + SHIFT⇧ + G** on Finder.
3. Paste the copy inside the folder.


### I can't find the folder
If you have never created a custom theme on Xcode before the folder ```~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/``` will not exist.

To create it you just need to duplicate one of the existing themes using the ```+``` button on the bottom left corner of the theme chooser interface, in Xcode Preferences.
